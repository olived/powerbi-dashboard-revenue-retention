## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Solution

- **Data Model:**  
  - Star schema with `orders`, `order_items`, `customers`, `channels`, and `products` tables.  
  - Relationship established by primary/foreign keys (Customer ID, Order ID).

- **DAX Measures:**  
  ```DAX
  Total Revenue = SUM(order_items[price])

  Total Orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(orders[order_id])

  Average Ticket = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Orders])
